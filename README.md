### Basic Usage

The easiest way to install faketerminal.js is via [Bower](http://bower.io).

### Compiling LESS and JS

I use Grunt to compile everything. Firstly, install `grunt-cli` globally. It's recommended to run the grunt client on a
per-project basis, so if you have it installed globally, remove it.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install the dev dependancies

    npm install

Call `grunt` in the project root

    grunt

If you wish to start the watcher, you can do so by calling:

    grunt autocompile

All the Less and JS files will be watched for changes, and compiled if necessary.



### RoadMap

- [ ] Complete this README.md
- [ ] Use a promise based system for commands
- [ ] Allow more dynamic customisation, e.g. a callable for customisng the prompt
